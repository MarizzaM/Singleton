1
The suspend() method of thread class puts the thread from running to waiting state.
The resume () method resume the suspended thread

Suspend and Resume functions are deprecated, becouse deadlock can occur when using them

2
The purpose of Wait and Pulse is to provide a simple signaling mechanism: Wait blocks until it receives notification from another thread
Pulse provides that notification
A call to Pulse() resumes the first thread in the queue of threads waiting for the lock.
A call to PulseAll signals the release of the lock to all waiting threads.

3
A race condition occurs when two or more threads are able to access shared data and they try to change it at the same time.

4
A deadlock is a situation where an application locks up because two or more activities are waiting for each other to finish.

5
One must specify a synchronizing object when calling Wait or Pulse

6
Design patterns are solutions to software design problems you find again and again in real-world application development. 
The 23 Gang of Four (GoF) patterns are generally considered the foundation for all other patterns.
7
The Singleton pattern assures only a single instance (the singleton) of the class can be created
8
            - 1 instance of the class [static]
            - 2 acess will be using a static method
            - 3 every instance will be the same
            - 4 impossible to create more then 1 object
            - 5 thread-safe
            - 6 cannot change the singleton
